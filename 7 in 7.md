## Prototype 1
#### Question: How can I establish the rules to show the relationship between music and visual pattern?

For the first prototype, I continued the process I've done before to draw a pattern for my friend's composition. But this time I tried to establish a rule of the relationship between visual work and music. I'll give this picture to my friend again and asked him how he will compose according it. This time I find like it's so hard to establish a rule because there is lots of parameters in both music and visual pattern. What I wanna find before, the emotion of certain chords or certain progresion, is not existed as well because there are many other parameters in the music would affect emotion. On the other hand, the same chords progression might lead to different emotion if they are in different context. So I decided to do this in a different direction.

## Prototype 2
#### Question: How can I show the timeline of a music in different visual ways?
Whether to visualize music or to translate visual pattern into music all need to consider the timeline of music. So for prototpye 2, I was thinking about indicating timeline in different ways. I don't want to be limited to 2D medium, so I tried to indicate timeline in 3D space.

## Prototype 3
#### Question: How can I get people interactive with my project? How can I make making music more accesible by using some visual pattern? How can I make people create melody by drawing?

I found it pretty interesting to make a rule of translating what people draw into music. This time I only considered pitch and bass line. I really want to explore more for the next day. I'd consider how to create melody and chord progression with visual pattern.


## Prototype 4
#### Question: How can I help people feel and understand the nature of music by making their own music clips? How can I let people create chord progression by using visual pattern?
I did a small research before. There are two webside of using computer keyboard to make music. 

[patatap](https://patatap.com)

[mikutap](https://aidn.jp/mikutap/)

I asked people which one do they prefer and why, and I found that they all prefered mikutap because they could play music randomly. The result was as I expected. The reason behind it is that mikutap provides an accompany, or a certian chord progression, when people press the computer keyboard to create melody, making the experience more "musical". Also, mikutap only use pentatonic scale in which all the notes are harmonious with the accompany, making it sound good whatever keys people press. However, patatap is more like "sound effect" rather than "music". For me, I'm about to make things more musical, so I came up with today's guiding question.
#### Inspiration
This prototype is inspired by the color version of Tonnetz, or "tone network", found in Riemannian theory. It is an arrangement of notes to illustrate harmonies and their relationships.

I found the process so interesting and I think there's a lot I can do to make it better.
